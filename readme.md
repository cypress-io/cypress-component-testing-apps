# Getting Started with Cypress Login App

This repo contains several examples of the
[Cypress Component Testing Getting Started app](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/writing-your-first-component-test)
in various frameworks and libraries.

To get started with an example, clone the repo, go into the desired directory,
and `npm install`, and then run the application as you normally would for that
framework (see the folders readme file).
