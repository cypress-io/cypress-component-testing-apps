# Getting Started with Cypress Login App

This repo contains several examples of the
[Cypress Component Testing Getting Started app](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/writing-your-first-component-test)
in various frameworks and libraries.

To get started with an example, first clone the repo.

Use the recommended version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as shown by the file [.node-version](./.node-version) contents.
The repo [node-version-usage](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage) contains a list of Node.js version managers that read and use the contents of a [.node-version](./.node-version) file to install and use the specified version.

Go into the desired directory, execute `npm install`,
and then run the application as you normally would for that
framework (see the folder's readme file).
